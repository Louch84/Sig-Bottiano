3. Send `!prices` or `!africa` based on interest
4. Push for close: "You ready to proceed?"
5. Send `!payment` when ready

### Common Responses:

**"Is this real?"**
```
100% real! We're based in Philadelphia, USA.

- Warehouse: Edison, NJ
- Website: luchianowireless.netlify.app
- WhatsApp: +1 12152848650

We ship daily to Nigeria/Ghana/Kenya via DHL.

You can pay after I send tracking number if you're concerned.

What phone you interested in?
```

**"Can I pay on delivery?"**
```
We don't do COD (too many scams from both sides).

But here's what we CAN do:
- 50% deposit to ship
- 50% on delivery
- Or full payment via secure methods (MTN MoMo, USDT)

We've shipped 100+ phones successfully.

Fair?
```

**"Too expensive"**
```
What's your budget? I might have something.

We got:
- Budget options (iPhone 11, XR from $240)
- Samsung A-series from $180
- Blacklist options (40% cheaper)

Or if you buying 5+ units, I can do wholesale pricing.

How many you looking for?
