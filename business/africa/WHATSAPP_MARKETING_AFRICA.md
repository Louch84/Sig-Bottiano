## 📊 Finding WhatsApp Groups

### Method 1: Facebook Groups
1. Search: "iPhone Nigeria Buy Sell"
2. Join group (answer questions honestly)
3. Look for WhatsApp links in:
   - Group description
   - Pinned posts
   - Comment sections
   - Member posts

### Method 2: Google Search
```
site:facebook.com "WhatsApp group link" iPhone Nigeria
site:whatsapp.com "invite" phone dealers Lagos
```

### Method 3: Ask Existing Contacts
- Message anyone you know in Africa
- "Yo, you know any WhatsApp groups for phone buyers?"
- They'll add you or share links

### Method 4: Instagram/TikTok
- Search #iPhoneNigeria #LagosPhones
- DM sellers, ask for group invites
- Comment on posts, people will DM you

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### DO:
✅ Post during peak hours (evening Africa time)
✅ Use emojis (🔥📱💰🚚)
✅ Include clear prices (no "DM for price")
✅ Respond within 5 minutes (Africa buyers are impatient)
✅ Send voice notes (builds trust)
✅ Share tracking numbers immediately
✅ Ask for reviews after delivery

### DON'T:
❌ Spam groups (post 1-2x max per group per week)
❌ Use generic stock photos (use real warehouse photos)
❌ Say "blacklist" upfront (say "network unlocked" instead)
❌ Promise what you can't deliver
❌ Argue with customers (refund if needed)
❌ Post at 3 AM Africa time (you'll look like a scammer)
