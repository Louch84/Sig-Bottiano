## SCRIPT 1: "My Portfolio's in Shambles"

**Visual:** You looking at phone, face of despair

**Hook (0-3s):**
*Looking at portfolio, camera zooms in*
> "Yo... my portfolio looking like the 76ers in the playoffs."

**Body (3-45s):**
> "Everything red. Everything. I got stocks bleeding harder than a cheesesteak wit extra grease.
> 
> My AMC position? Down bad. Looking like that boul who bet his rent money on the Eagles to win the Super Bowl... in 2023.
> 
> But check it - that's why we play OPTIONS, baby! Limited risk! You can't lose more than you put in...
> 
> ...unlike my cousin who 'invested' his whole stimulus in Dogecoin at 70 cents. He working at Wawa now. Real rap.
> 
> Moral of the story? When the market drawlin', you either cry in the club or learn the Greeks. Theta, Delta, Gamma - them the real MVPs."

**CTA:**
> "Follow so you don't end up working at Wawa. Respectfully."

**Text on screen:** 
- "POV: You checked your portfolio"
- "Me watching Theta decay like 👀"
- "At least it's not Dogecoin 💀"

## SCRIPT 2: "Short Sellers vs Me"

**Visual:** Split screen or acting out both sides

**Hook (0-3s):**
*Serious face, dramatic music*
> "Short sellers think they slick..."

**Body (3-45s):**
> "They over there borrowing shares, talking 'bout 'this stock going to zero' - mind you, this same company got more cash than me on payday.
> 
> Short sellers be like: 'We're going to crush this company!'
> 
> Me and the apes: 'Bet.'
> 
> Next thing you know, the stock up 300% and they on CNBC crying like they didn't try to bankrupt GameStop for clout. 
> 
> Short sellers fold faster than a lawn chair at a cookout when you see your ex pull up. Facts.
> 
> That's why I scan for short squeeze setups. When you see 40% short interest and days to cover over 7? That's not a stock, that's a powder keg. And I'm holding the match."

**CTA:**
> "Follow for the squeeze plays before they explode. No Wawa job required."

**Text on screen:**
- "Short sellers: This is going to $0"
- "The stock: 📈📈📈"
- "Their faces: 😭"

## SCRIPT 3: "When the Trade Hits Different"

**Visual:** Acting out the emotional journey

**Hook (0-3s):**
*Excited, dancing*
> "When you buy a call option for $5 and it hit $500..."

**Body (3-45s):**
> "You ever catch a 100-bagger so fast you gotta check if your phone glitching?
> 
> I'm talking $5 to $500 in one day. That's not a trade, that's a COME UP.
> 
> I was sitting there looking at my screen like: 'Is this real? Am I being punk'd? Where Ashton at?'
> 
> My mama called - 'You still looking for a job?' 
> 
> Me: 'Mama, I AM the job now.'
> 
> She said: 'You still drawing?'
> 
> Drawing? Mama, I'm REMBRANDING. I got a scanner that finds these jawns before they pop. 11 seconds. I'm basically a superhero at this point. Call me The Optionator.
> 
> But real rap - for every 100-bagger, there's ten trades that go to zero. This casino don't discriminate. You gotta have stops tighter than security at the Roots Picnic."

**CTA:**
> "Follow if you trying to catch bangers, not bags. Let's get it."

**Text on screen:**
- "$5 → $500"
- "Me refreshing my brokerage app: 👀"
- "My account: 🚀"
- "Reality: 90% of options expire worthless"

## COMEDY TIPS:

✅ Self-deprecating humor works (my losses, my mistakes)
✅ Relatable Philly references (Wawa, Pat's, 76ers, SEPTA)
✅ Exaggerate the emotions (despair, excitement, confusion)
✅ Call out the absurdity of trading (it's gambling with extra steps)
✅ Use callbacks (mentioning Wawa jobs multiple times)
✅ Make fun of yourself before others do
