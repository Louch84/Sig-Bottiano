# TikTok Trade Content - NOK PUT + KMI CALL

## Trade 1: NOK $7 PUT

**Thesis:**
- NOK was at ~$8.20 when we scanned earlier
- Scanner showed high call flow (gamma squeeze potential)
- BUT you took the PUT at $7 strike
- This is a CONTRARIAN play - betting the gamma squeeze FAILS
- OR protective hedge against a long position

**TikTok Angle:**
"Scanner said CALLS, I bought PUTS - here's why"
- Explain: When everyone's buying calls, sometimes the opposite works
- Show: Scanner detected flow, but you saw overextension
- Risk: Only $8 (cheap bet against the crowd)

**Price Action to Watch:**
- NOK needs to drop below $7 for max profit
- Break-even: ~$6.92 (assuming $0.08 entry)
- Time decay: 11 days to expiration (3/7)

## Trade 2: KMI $34.5 CALL

**Thesis:**
- KMI at $33.16 when we first flagged it
- Low Conviction Pattern: Price up on RVOL 0.06x (extremely low volume)
- Your breakeven: $34.50 + premium (~$0.25) = $34.75
- Current price action will determine outcome

**TikTok Angle:**
"The 'Stealth Accumulation' Pattern - Real Time"
- Show: Low volume rally = cheap options opportunity
- Explain: When volume returns = explosive move
- Track: Document if pattern works or fails (accountability)

**Price Action to Watch:**
- Need KMI above $34.75 for profit
- Support at $33 (SMA20)
- Energy sector momentum (oil/gas prices)
