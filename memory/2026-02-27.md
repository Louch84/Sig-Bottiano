# 2026-02-27 - Revenue Mode Activated

## 🚨 Critical Constraint: API Limits

**Issue:** Qwen model API limits hit yesterday
- Local Ollama setup attempted but didn't work
- **Reality:** Need revenue to afford API upgrades
- **Mindset:** Business first, AI upgrades after profit

**Workaround Strategy:**
- Batch operations efficiently
- Focus on high-impact actions only
- Use unlimited tools: file ops, shell, git
- Minimize web searches, maximize execution

## 💭 Strategic Insights

**API Limit Reality Check:**
- Free tier = limited but usable
- Local models = not ready yet (Ollama setup failed)
- **Solution:** Make money → upgrade API → more capability
- This is the bootstrap loop: revenue funds growth

**Business Model Validation:**
- Zero monthly costs possible (Netlify + Tally + WhatsApp all free)
- Margins support API costs: 1 phone sale = weeks of API credits
- Africa market = 2-3x USA margins (worth logistics)
- Bulk inventory = leverage for wholesale deals

**Operating Principle:**
> Don't let perfect AI stop profitable action. Sell first, upgrade after.
