Here’s how you can find these smart wallets and copy their moves.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nhttps://coincodecap.com/go/inline-ads\\n\\n- [1.

Use Blockchain Explorers\\n\\nThink of [blockchain explorers](https://coincodecap.com/best-osint-tools-for-investigating-cryptocurrency) like binoculars for Solana wallets. Websites like Solscan or Solana Beach let you peek into what [wallets](https://coincodecap.com/metamask-vs-coinbase-wallet) are up to—what they’re buying, selling, and holding. If you spot a wallet that keeps making profitable moves, you might wanna [keep an eye](https://coincodecap.com/top-5-cryptos-to-keep-an-eye-on-this-week) on it.\\n\\n👉 Example: You see a wallet that bought a [memecoin](https://coincodecap.com/memecoin-buy-of-the-month-buy-floki-at-these-levels) early and sold it for 10x profit—you could follow its next move!\\n\\n## 2. Dune Analytics Dashboards\\n\\nDune Analytics is like a scoreboard that helps you find the most [successful traders](https://coincodecap.com/top-10-most-successful-forex-traders-in-the-world). Some dashboards even filter out the bad ones and show only wallets that have been making good [money](https://coincodecap.com/all-the-money-in-the-world) consistently.\\n\\n👉 Example: You find a dashboard showing [“Top 100 most profitable Solana](https://coincodecap.com/top-10-nfts-to-buy) wallets”—now you know who to copy!\\n\\n## 3. Join Crypto Communities (Like Reddit & Twitter)\\n\\nCrypto folks love to talk about wins and losses. Places like Reddit (r/solana) and [Twitter](https://coincodecap.com/brazil-halts-x-operations-after-elon-musk-defies-local-representative-order) (X) are goldmines for finding hot wallets. People sometimes share big wins, wallet addresses, or [strategies](https://coincodecap.com/profitable-casino-strategies-that-work) that can help you copy their moves.\\n\\n👉 Example: Someone posts, “This wallet turned $500 into $50K in 2 weeks!”—you grab that [wallet address and track](https://coincodecap.com/crypto-investigation-firms) it.\\n\\n## 4. Use Copy Trading Bots\\n\\nWhy do the tracking yourself when a [bot](https://coincodecap.com/banana-gun-bot-sniper) can do it for you? There are [bots](https://coincodecap.com/10-best-sniper-bots-for-solana-memecoins) on GitHub that you can set up to automatically copy trades from successful wallets. It’s like having a [robot](https://coincodecap.com/best-ai-humanoid-robots) assistant that trades like a pro without you lifting a finger.\\n\\n👉 Example: You set up a bot that follows a wallet that made 100x gains [last month](https://coincodecap.com/the-crypto-market-has-seen-136-investments-in-the-last-month), and now it trades exactly like them for you!\\n\\n## 5. Follow Solana Traders on Social Media\\n\\nPro traders often drop hints about what they’re buying and selling on Twitter, Telegram, and [Discord](https://coincodecap.com/best-discord-voice-changers). By following the right people, you can get early insights into what’s about to pump.\\n\\n👉 Example: A trader tweets, “Loading up on $MOONCOIN,” and hours later, the [price](https://coincodecap.com/reply-guy-time-to-fire-your-marketing-intern) explodes—you could’ve bought in early!\\n\\n## 6. Use Special Tools (Like SolSqueezer)\\n\\nThere are tools built just for [tracking wallets](https://coincodecap.com/digital-identity-for-bitcoin-can-governments-track-down-your-private-wallets) that are killing it. One such tool is SolSqueezer, which scans the blockchain and finds wallets that are making big profits.\\n\\n👉 Example: Instead of spending hours searching, you just use SolSqueezer, and boom—it shows you the top most profitable wallets [instantly](https://coincodecap.com/10-best-alternatives-to-instantly).\\n\\n## 7. Look at Wallet Performance Metrics\\n\\nSome wallets might look profitable at first, but they could just be lucky. To find truly good traders, check for things like:\\n✔ ROI above 100% (they’re actually [making money](https://coincodecap.com/ways-to-make-money-as-a-kid))\\n✔ Win rate over 60% (most of their [trades are successful](https://coincodecap.com/top-5-best-kraken-trading-signals-groups-maximize-your-crypto-trading-success))\\n✔ Not too many trades (too much buying/selling can mean they’re [gambling](https://coincodecap.com/7bit-casino-review))\\n\\n👉 Example: You find a wallet with 200% ROI and 80% win rate—this is someone worth copying.\\n\\n## 8. Use Copy Trading Platforms (Like CryptoRobotics)\\n\\nSome websites do all the work for you. Platforms like CryptoRobotics let you copy-trade profitable traders with just a few clicks. It’s like auto-pilot trading—you just pick a good trader, and the platform mirrors their moves for you.\\n\\n👉 Example: You pick a trader with 500% gains, and CryptoRobotics automatically copies their trades into your account.\\n\\n## 9. Keep Up with Market Trends\\n\\nSome traders don’t just buy random coins—they follow big trends in crypto. If you stay updated with news and market movements, you can understand why profitable wallets do what they do.\\n\\n👉 Example: You see news that [Solana memecoins](https://coincodecap.com/top-memecoin-projects-to-watch-out-for-in-the-future) are exploding, and suddenly, profitable wallets are all buying meme tokens. You get in early and ride the wave!\\n\\n## 10. Watch Tutorials & Learn the Game\\n\\n[Even if you’re copy-trading](https://coincodecap.com/bingbon-copy-trading), it helps to understand what’s happening. Watching YouTube tutorials or following step-by-step guides can teach you how to spot good wallets, [set up trading bots](https://coincodecap.com/tips-for-maximizing-profits-with-solana-telegram-trading-bots), and avoid scams.\\n\\n👉 Example: You watch a 30-min tutorial on [copy trading](https://coincodecap.com/best-copy-trading-apps-in-india), and now you know exactly what to do to start making money.\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nIf you wanna make money without constantly trading, [copy trading on Solana](https://coincodecap.com/mevx-vs-other-trading-bots-how-does-it-compare) can be a great move. Just remember:\\n✔ Find profitable wallets (use explorers, analytics, and tools)\\n✔ Use [bots or copy-trading platforms](https://coincodecap.com/nova-bot-detailed-review) (to automate the process)\\n✔ Stay updated on market [trends](https://coincodecap.com/best-soccer-turf-shoes) (so you know why things are moving)\\n\\nAnd there you have it, fellow crypto explorers! You’re now armed with 10 solid [strategies](https://coincodecap.com/best-algorithmic-trading-strategies) to find the best Solana wallets and copy-trade like a pro. Whether you’re using blockchain explorers, trading bots, or [social media](https://coincodecap.com/best-social-media-management-tools) signals, the key is to follow smart money and make informed moves.\\n\\nRemember, [copy trading](https://coincodecap.com/copy-trading-platforms-australia) isn’t about blindly following any wallet—it’s about tracking consistent winners, understanding why they’re profitable, and using the right tools to automate your gains. By staying updated on market trends and learning the [game](https://coincodecap.com/top-gaming-companies-you-should-know), you can maximize your chances of success.\\n\\nSo, are you ready to let the pros do the hard work while you reap the rewards? 🤑 Start exploring, start tracking, and most importantly—trade smart!\\n\\n- [Best Video Conferencing Software in 2023](https://coincodecap.com/best-video-conferencing-software)\\n- [UK Recognizes Cryptocurrency as Regulated Financial Activity: New Bill Passed](https://coincodecap.com/uk-recognizes-cryptocurrency-as-regulated-financial-activity-new-bill-passed)\\n- [DYDX Trading in a Narrow Range!

Sounds cool, right? Well, with copy trading, you can track profitable Solana wallets and mirror their trades for potential gains!

Here’s how you can find these smart wallets and copy their moves.\n\nTable of Contents\nhttps://coincodecap.com/go/inline-ads\n\n- [1. Use Blockchain Explorers](#1_Use_Blockchain_Explorers)\n- [2.

Watch Tutorials & Learn the Game](#10_Watch_Tutorials_Learn_the_Game)\n- [Final Thoughts](#Final_Thoughts)\n\n## 1. Use Blockchain Explorers\n\nThink of [blockchain explorers](https://coincodecap.com/best-osint-tools-for-investigating-cryptocurrency) like binoculars for Solana wallets. Websites like Solscan or Solana Beach let you peek into what [wallets](https://coincodecap.com/metamask-vs-coinbase-wallet) are up to—what they’re buying, selling, and holding. If you spot a wallet that keeps making profitable moves, you might wanna [keep an eye](https://coincodecap.com/top-5-cryptos-to-keep-an-eye-on-this-week) on it.\n\n👉 Example: You see a wallet that bought a [memecoin](https://coincodecap.com/memecoin-buy-of-the-month-buy-floki-at-these-levels) early and sold it for 10x profit—you could follow its next move!\n\n## 2. Dune Analytics Dashboards\n\nDune Analytics is like a scoreboard that helps you find the most [successful traders](https://coincodecap.com/top-10-most-successful-forex-traders-in-the-world). Some dashboards even filter out the bad ones and show only wallets that have been making good [money](https://coincodecap.com/all-the-money-in-the-world) consistently.\n\n👉 Example: You find a dashboard showing [“Top 100 most profitable Solana](https://coincodecap.com/top-10-nfts-to-buy) wallets”—now you know who to copy!\n\n## 3. Join Crypto Communities (Like Reddit & Twitter)\n\nCrypto folks love to talk about wins and losses. Places like Reddit (r/solana) and [Twitter](https://coincodecap.com/brazil-halts-x-operations-after-elon-musk-defies-local-representative-order) (X) are goldmines for finding hot wallets. People sometimes share big wins, wallet addresses, or [strategies](https://coincodecap.com/profitable-casino-strategies-that-work) that can help you copy their moves.\n\n👉 Example: Someone posts, “This wallet turned $500 into $50K in 2 weeks!”—you grab that [wallet address and track](https://coincodecap.com/crypto-investigation-firms) it.\n\n## 4. Use Copy Trading Bots\n\nWhy do the tracking yourself when a [bot](https://coincodecap.com/banana-gun-bot-sniper) can do it for you? There are [bots](https://coincodecap.com/10-best-sniper-bots-for-solana-memecoins) on GitHub that you can set up to automatically copy trades from successful wallets. It’s like having a [robot](https://coincodecap.com/best-ai-humanoid-robots) assistant that trades like a pro without you lifting a finger.\n\n👉 Example: You set up a bot that follows a wallet that made 100x gains [last month](https://coincodecap.com/the-crypto-market-has-seen-136-investments-in-the-last-month), and now it trades exactly like them for you!\n\n## 5. Follow Solana Traders on Social Media\n\nPro traders often drop hints about what they’re buying and selling on Twitter, Telegram, and [Discord](https://coincodecap.com/best-discord-voice-changers). By following the right people, you can get early insights into what’s about to pump.\n\n👉 Example: A trader tweets, “Loading up on $MOONCOIN,” and hours later, the [price](https://coincodecap.com/reply-guy-time-to-fire-your-marketing-intern) explodes—you could’ve bought in early!\n\n## 6. Use Special Tools (Like SolSqueezer)\n\nThere are tools built just for [tracking wallets](https://coincodecap.com/digital-identity-for-bitcoin-can-governments-track-down-your-private-wallets) that are killing it. One such tool is SolSqueezer, which scans the blockchain and finds wallets that are making big profits.\n\n👉 Example: Instead of spending hours searching, you just use SolSqueezer, and boom—it shows you the top most profitable wallets [instantly](https://coincodecap.com/10-best-alternatives-to-instantly).\n\n## 7.

They are trader wallets with verified PNL. Always do your own due diligence - past performance doesn't guarantee future results.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Tools & Platforms for Copy Trading\n\n### Dedicated Copy Trading Platforms\n\n| Platform | Features | Cost |\n|----------|----------|------|\n| **Axiom Trade** | Leaderboards, PNL rankings, copy automation, Twitter sentiment tracking | Free tier + premium |\n| **GMGN AI** | Real-time wallet tracking, KOL/whale categorization, first 70 buyers | Free + paid tiers |\n| **KOLScan** (acquired by Pump.fun) | KOL wallet tracking, transaction alerts, PNL analytics | Free tier available |\n| **Avo** | Copy top portfolios via Discord, curated trader lists | Subscription-based |\n\n### Blockchain Explorers (Manual Tracking)\n\n- **Solscan** - solscan.io\n- **Solana Beach** - solana.beach\n- **Solscan API** - For programmatic access\n\n### Analytics Dashboards (Dune)\n\n- [Solana Top Traders](https://dune.com/xoulomon/token-top-tradersolana)\n- [Daily Top 100 Solana Traders](https://dune.com/muurtorr/top-100-solana-traders)\n- [Solana Alpha Wallets](https://dune.com/pixelz/solana-alpha-wallet-signals)\n\n### Copy Trading Bots (Execute Trades Automatically)\n\n- **Banana Gun** - Popular sniper bot\n- **Trojan** - Automated copy trading\n- **BonkBot** - Fast execution for memecoins\n- **MevX** - Auto-copy from tracked wallets\n\n---\n\n## 3. Patterns in Successful Memecoin Traders\n\nBased on research from top performers:\n\n### Entry Patterns\n- **First 70 buyers** on Pump.fun - critical for catching 100x moonshots\n- **Early Pump.fun launches** - buying within first few minutes of token creation\n- **Insider signals** - following wallets with proven track records\n\n### Risk Management\n- Win rate >60% (top traders often 80%+)\n- ROI above 100%\n- Don't chase - wait for confirmed patterns\n- Avoid tokens <24 hours old unless following strong signals\n\n### What to Look For\n- Consistent PNL over time (not just one lucky trade)\n- Low rug history - wallets that avoid scams\n- Trading volume that matches account size (not over-leveraged)\n- Focus on Solana native tokens (less ETH bridge risk)\n\n### Red Flags\n- Wallets with too many trades (gambling, not trading)\n- Only buying tokens with no volume\n- Inconsistent results over 30+ days\n\n---\n\n## 4. Programmatic Wallet Tracking\n\n### API Options\n\n| Provider | Features | Pricing |\n|----------|----------|---------|\n| **Helius** | Webhooks, parsed transactions, low latency | Free tier + paid |\n| **Alchemy** | Full RPC access, transaction history | Free tier available |\n| **SolanaTracker** | Real-time token/wallet data, global RPC nodes | Free tier + paid |\n| **SHYFT** | RPC access, wallet tracking | ~$59/month |\n| **Mobula** | Wallet + market data combined | Free tier available |\n\n### Quick Start: Helius Webhooks (Easiest)\n\n1. Get API key at [helius.dev](https://helius.dev)\n2. Set up webhook for wallet address\n3. Receive real-time notifications when wallet trades\n\n### Code Example: Track Wallet with Node.js\n\n```javascript\nconst { Connection, PublicKey } = require('@solana/web3.js');\n\nconst RPC_URL = 'YOUR_HELIUS_OR_ALCHEMY_URL';\nconst connection = new Connection(RPC_URL);\n\nconst WALLET_TO_TRACK = 'AVAZvHLR2PcWpDf8BXY4rVxNHYRBytycHkcB5z5QNXYm';\nconst pubkey = new PublicKey(WALLET_TO_TRACK);\n\n// Get recent transactions\nasync function getRecentTrades() {\n  const signatures = await connection.getSignaturesForAddress(pubkey, { limit: 10 });\n  \n  for (const sig of signatures) {\n    const tx = await connection.getParsedTransaction(sig.signature);\n    console.log('Transaction:', sig.signature);\n    // Parse token buys/sells here\n  }\n}\n\ngetRecentTrades();\n```\n\n### Python Alternative\n\n```python\nfrom solders.keypair import Keypair\nfrom solana.rpc.websocket_api import connect\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def main():\n    async with connect(\"wss://api.mainnet.solana.com\") as websocket:\n        wallet = Keypair()  # Your wallet\n        await websocket.account_subscribe(wallet.pubkey())\n        # Listen for events\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Setup Instructions for Louch\n\n### Option A: Manual Tracking (Easiest - Start Here)\n\n1. **Create accounts on:**\n   - [GMGN.ai](https://gmgn.ai/monitor/Leveling?chain=sol) - Free\n   - [Axiom Trade](https://axiom.trade/@tradenow) - Free\n\n2. **Add wallets to watchlist:**\n   - AVAZvHLR2PcWpDf8BXY4rVxNHYRBytycHkcB5z5QNXYm\n   - 4Be9CvxqHW6BYiRAxW9Q3xu1ycTMWaL5z8NX4HR3ha7t\n   - 8zFZHuSRuDpuAR7J6FzwyF3vKNx4CVW3DFHJerQhc7Zd\n   - H72yLkhTnoBfhBTXXaj1RBXuirm8s8G5fcVh2XpQLggM\n\n3. **Set up alerts** on these platforms for new buys\n\n4. **When alert fires:**\n   - Check token on DexScreener/Birdeye\n   - Evaluate token quality (volume, holders, liquidity)\n   - Execute trade manually on Phantom/Bonk/etc.\n\n### Option B: Automated Copy Trading (Advanced)\n\n1. **Get a copy trading bot:**\n   - Banana Gun (Telegram-based)\n   - Trojan (supports wallet copying)\n\n2. **Configure bot to track wallets**\n\n3. **Set position sizing** (recommend 1-5% of bankroll per trade)\n\n4. **Set stop-loss** (recommend 20-30% max loss per trade)\n\n### Recommended Workflow\n\n1. **Start with Option A** - learn the patterns\n2. **Use small position sizes** - 0.5-1 SOL to test\n3. **Track your results** - record every trade in a spreadsheet\n4. **Scale up gradually** as you learn what works\n\n---\n\n## 6. Key Resources\n\n- **Subreddit:** r/solana (search \"copy trading wallets\")\n- **Discord:** Avo bot for copy trading\n- ** Dune Dashboards:** Listed above\n- **Reddit thread on 99% win rate wallet:** https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1gyehdz/\n\n---\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis is RESEARCH ONLY. Copy trading involves significant risk. Memecoins are highly volatile. Only trade with money you can afford to lose. Always verify wallet addresses independently before following.\n","file_path":"memory/copy-trade-research.md"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":10687,"output":1978,"cacheRead":10346,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":23011,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771454563529}}
