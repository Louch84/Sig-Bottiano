Now I have real data from pump.fun on DEX Screener. I can see tokens under $50K MC. Let me analyze the data:\n\nLooking at the list, I can see many tokens with MC under $50K:\n\n1. **honk/SOL** - $15K MC, 81.43% progress, 102h old, $66K volume - This looks good!\n2. **Downstein/SOL** - $4.4K MC, 36.06% progress\n3. **?MOSQUE/SOL** - $18K MC, 86.36% progress\n4. **?BAWK/SOL** - $16K MC, 84.07% progress\n5. **TRP/SOL** - $11K MC, 74.66% progress\n6. **GROKIUS/SOL** - $12K MC, 74.91% progress\n7. **WIF/SOL** - $8.2K MC (different from WIF)\n8. **Allahu Akbar/SOL** - $10K MC\n9. **Dalaotian/SOL** - $12K MC\n10. **habibi/SOL** - $8.3K MC\n11. **CL/SOL** - $13K MC\n12. **habibi/SOL** (another) - $16K MC\n13. **kekcoin/SOL** - $15K MC\n14. **?KIMJAK/SOL** - $19K MC\n15. **?Deen/SOL** - $20K MC\n16. **?Inshallah/SOL** - $7.2K MC\n17. **?Muezza/SOL** - $5.7K MC (just launched, 59s old!)\n18. And many more...\n\nNow I need to check for volume spikes (3+ SOL in 5 min), growing holders, and rug pull checks. Let me also check for Twitter/X buzz on these.\n\nLooking at the volume column (5M), I can see some have good volume:\n\n\n- honk: 554 (5M) - very high!\n- Downstein: 1,041 - good\n- ?MOSQUE: 425 - good\n- ?BAWK: 291 - good\n- TRP: 770 - good\n- GROKIUS: 353 - good\n- WIF: 284 - decent\n\nNow let me select a few promising ones to analyze further. Based on the data, I should prioritize:\n1. Lower MC (under $20K)\n2. Higher volume (especially 5M volume)\n3. Some momentum (price change)\n4. Not too old (less than 24h is ideal)\n\nThe strongest candidates appear to be honk with $15K MC and exceptional 5M volume of 554, plus Downstein at just $4.4K MC with 1,041 in 5M volume. I should also check ?MOSQUE and ?BAWK since they show solid volume and are gaining traction quickly.","thinkingSignature":"569ebfcf5c10abf264cec53fe2f72c2f7d5d7e9763c0f92c2f5b479334dc0790"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_function_thdnnhxh4n32_1","name":"web_search","arguments":{"count":5,"freshness":"pd","query":"honk SOL pumpfun token contract address"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":19981,"output":702,"cacheRead":12031,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":32714,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771407578174}}
