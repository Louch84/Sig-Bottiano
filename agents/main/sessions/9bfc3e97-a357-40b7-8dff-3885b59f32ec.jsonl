While the broader market showed resilience, the spotlight remained firmly on the artificial intelligence (AI) sector and the looming quarterly report from the industry’s primary bellwether.\\n\\n## Major Market Indexes Performance Recap\\n\\nThe technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ([^IXIC](/stock/%5EIXIC)) was the standout performer of the day, climbing 0.7% to close at a new all-time high of 16,794.87. This milestone was driven largely by continued optimism surrounding AI integration across the software and hardware sectors. The [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/) ([^GSPC](/stock/%5EGSPC)) managed a more modest gain, edging up 0.1% to finish at 5,308.13, placing it just points away from its own record territory.\\n\\nIn contrast, the [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx) Industrial Average ([^DJI](/stock/%5EDJI)) faced downward pressure, slipping 0.5% or nearly 200 points to end at 39,806.77. This pullback follows the Dow’s historic close above the 40,000 threshold late last week, as investors took profits in industrial and financial heavyweights. Small-cap stocks also saw some buying interest, with the Russell 2000 ([^RUT](/stock/%5ERUT)) rising 0.3% to finish at 2,102.50.\\n\\n## After-Hours Earnings and Corporate Developments\\n\\nThe momentum continued after the closing bell with several high-profile earnings releases. Palo Alto Networks ([PANW](/stock/PANW)) saw its shares fluctuate in extended trading after reporting quarterly results that highlighted a shift in its \\\"platformization\\\" strategy. While the company met revenue expectations, investors are closely parsing its updated guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year.\\n\\nZoom Video ([ZM](/stock/ZM)) also reported after the close, beating analyst estimates for both top and bottom lines. The company’s focus on enterprise AI tools appears to be gaining traction, providing a boost to its stock in the after-hours session. Earlier in the day, Li Auto ([LI](/stock/LI)) shares faced volatility after the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer reported a dip in vehicle margins, highlighting the intensifying price war in the global EV market.\\n\\nOn the positive side, Norwegian Cruise Line ([NCLH](/stock/NCLH)) was one of the S&P 500's [top gainers](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/topstocks) during the regular session. The cruise operator raised its full-year profit forecast, citing robust demand and higher ticket prices, which sparked a rally across the broader travel and leisure sector.\\n\\n## Economic Outlook and Federal Reserve Sentiment\\n\\nMarket sentiment was also shaped by a series of speeches from Federal Reserve officials. Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr both emphasized a \\\"patient\\\" approach to monetary policy. Jefferson noted that while recent inflation data has been encouraging, it is still too early to determine if the disinflationary trend is sustainable enough to warrant immediate rate cuts.\\n\\nThese comments have kept Treasury yields relatively steady as traders recalibrate their expectations for the Fed's next move. The market is now pricing in a higher probability of rates remaining \\\"higher for longer,\\\" pending more definitive evidence of cooling price pressures.\\n\\n## Upcoming Market Events to Watch\\n\\nLooking ahead, the primary catalyst for the week remains the earnings report from Nvidia ([NVDA](/stock/NVDA)), scheduled for Wednesday after the close. As a cornerstone of the AI rally, Nvidia’s guidance is expected to set the tone for the entire tech sector, including peers like Microsoft ([MSFT](/stock/MSFT)), Apple ([AAPL](/stock/AAPL)), and Alphabet ([GOOGL](/stock/GOOGL)).\\n\\nAdditionally, investors are awaiting the release of the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting minutes on Wednesday, which could provide deeper insight into the committee's internal debates regarding inflation targets.
